Every organisation ends up using LDAP as primary single sign on, also they end up using Active Directory. while active directory is great, in this age of web based interfaces, we looked around and found few good solution, but then over weekend thought why not just do it on our own?

While Gate was conceived as providing rest based authentication, I hope it evolves into a better **Identity Management** and authentication and authorisation tool.

Gate is deployed at [GoJek][http://www.go-jek.com] and many more companies.

Check out the [Gate docs][gate-portal] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-docs]. If you have questions, you can ask thme by raising issue on main gate repo, we don't track issues on other repos
